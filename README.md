# CS50 PROBLEM SET1 - Hello

This repository contains my solution for a small exercise from Harvard's CS50 course. The program prompts the user to enter their name and then outputs a greeting message.

## Files
- `hello.c` : Main solution file that takes user input and prints a personalized greeting.

## Description
The program demonstrates:

- Reading input from the user
- Printing output to the console
- Using string variables in C
- Basic user interaction

When run, the program asks the user to input their name and prints:

Hello, <name>

## How to Run
Compile and run the program using GCC:

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
